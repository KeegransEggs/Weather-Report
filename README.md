# Weather-Report
Weather Report is an open source weather station project. It itilizes the ESP32-S3-Dev-Kit-N8R8 by Waveshare, the BME280 breakout board by Waveshare and a 16x2 LCD display, with an I2C module for ease of use. Weather Report also utilizes Blynk for visualization. The aim of this project is to create a small and cheap weather station that displays the parameters of temperature, humidity and air pressure. The project uses both a LCD display and Blynk, so that data can be viewed both from the app/dashboard from a distance or the user can view them in person on the display. There have also been added a clock function and a "Bad Weather" function which warns the user trough Blynk about pressure drops.
